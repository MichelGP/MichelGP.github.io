<h1>Hi there.</h1>
<p>My name is Michel van der Zijden, and I'm an IT generalist who specializes in monitoring, security and cloud. I'm the person you call when you need someone to manage your IT infrastructure, maintaining its security and performance.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about technology and I'm constantly learning new ways to make sure systems are running smoothly and securely. I'm always up to date on the latest technologies, and I'm proud to say that I'm an expert in cloud computing and cybersecurity. Plus, I'm the guy you can trust to get the job done right.</p>
<p>I'm not just an IT professional, I'm also a fitness enthusiast. I ride my road bike often, mostly up mountains, and I hit the gym regularly. This combination of physical and mental exercise keeps me sharp and focused when I'm working on a project.</p>
<p>If you're looking for an IT generalist who is knowledgeable, reliable and always up to date on the latest technologies, then you need look no further. I'm the guy for the job! And if you're wondering how I created this introduction, I used Open AI ChatGPT to write it for me.</p>
